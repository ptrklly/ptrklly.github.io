    I've worked at the intersection of the climate change and business for 6 years, first as an analyst of climate and energy policy and (especially carbon markets) and now as an impact investment advisor. 
    </p>
     <p> 
    Outside of work I enjoy playing bridge, rock climbing, learning to code (all poorly), and eating ice cream.

    <h2> More about my work</h2>
    <p>
   At <a href="http://imprintcap.com">Imprint Capital</a> I focus on finding and making investments that are good for the environment as well as profitable, on behalf of a wide variety of impact-minded clients (foundations, financial institutions, and family offices). 
    </p>
    <p>
    The deals I've worked on touch a wide variety of issues: cleantech venture capital, renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency project finance, forest and farmland management, and water. These investments have been both indirect (where our clients are limited partners in a venture capital fund, for example), and direct, both equity and debt.   
    </p>
    <p>
    Investments tend to vary in how they compromise environmental impact to achieve financial performance or vice versa, but you would be surprised at how often the twin goals of impact and financial return can benefit each other. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Prior to Imprint I worked for 4 years in climate change consulting and the carbon market, mostly in roles where I performed analysis of climate or energy policy.
