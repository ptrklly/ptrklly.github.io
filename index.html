    <p> 
 I've worked at the intersection of business and the environment for seven years, first as an analyst of climate and energy policy and the carbon markets, and now as an impact investor. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Outside of work I enjoy learning to play bridge, rock climb, and write code. 
    </p>
    <h2> More about my work</h2>
    <p>
   At <a href="http://imprintcap.com">Imprint Capital</a> I make investments that are good for the environment as well as profitable, on behalf of a wide variety of socially-minded clients (foundations, financial institutions, and family offices). 
    </p>
    <p>
    I've worked on deals in renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency project finance, forest and farmland management, and cleantech venture capital. They are both equity and debt, direct and indirect.   
    </p>
    <p>
    Investments vary in how they balance environmental impact and financial performance, but you would be surprised at how often the dual goals of impact and profit benefit each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Prior to Imprint I worked for four years in climate change consulting and the carbon market, mostly in roles where I analyzed of climate or energy policy. 
    </p>
