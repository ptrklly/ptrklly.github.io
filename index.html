    <p> 
 I've worked at the intersection of business and environmentalism for seven years, first as an analyst of climate and energy policy and the carbon markets, and now as an impact investment advisor. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Outside of work I enjoy learning to play bridge, rock climb, and write code. 
    </p>
    <h2> More about my work</h2>
    <p>
   At <a href="http://imprintcap.com">Imprint Capital</a> I find and make investments that are good for the environment as well as profitable, on behalf of a wide variety of socially-minded clients (foundations, financial institutions, and family offices). 
    </p>
    <p>
    The deals I've worked on touch a wide variety of issues: renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency project finance, management of forests and farmland, and cleantech venture capital. They are both equity and debt, direct and indirect (e.g., where we select a venture capital fund to invest on behalf of our clients).   
    </p>
    <p>
    Investments vary in how they balance environmental impact and financial performance, but you would be surprised at how often the dual goals of impact and financial return benefit each other. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Prior to Imprint I worked for four years in climate change consulting and the carbon market, mostly in roles where I analyzed of climate or energy policy.
